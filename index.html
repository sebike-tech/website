    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:3;">
        Based on the findings of the study, results revealed that Lumad adults in Glan, <br> 
        Sarangani Province have high knowledge and frequent use of medicinal herbs, however, <br>
        moderate perceived usefulness and duration of use indicate a gap between knowledge and sustained, <br>
        confident application. These concerns affect the safe, confident, and effective use of medicinal herbs for health management. <br>
        To address this, a <b>Community Herbal Education Program</b> is proposed as an intervention designed <br>
        to strengthen proper herbal medication practices through culturally responsive education, <br>
        integration of indigenous and scientific knowledge, and community-based training. <br>
        This program aims to promote responsible use of medicinal herbs and improve health outcomes among Lumad adults.

    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:3;">
        The effectiveness of the Community Herbal Education Program will be<br>
        measured through pre-assessment and post-assessment of participants’<br>
        knowledge and practices, observation checklists during workshops and<br>
        demonstrations, and feedback from participants, community health workers,<br>
        and local leaders. The data collected will be analyzed to determine the impact<br>
        of the program on participants’ knowledge, confidence, and proper use of<br>
        medicinal herbs.

<section class="Sustainability Plan">
    <h2>Sustainability Plan</h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:3;">
        The Community Herbal Education Program may be sustained by<br>
        integrating herbal education activities into regular community health programs<br>
        and local wellness initiatives. Community health workers, local leaders, and<br>
        trained participants can continue conducting workshops, demonstrations, and<br>
        monitoring sessions. Partnerships with the LGU and NGOs can provide<br>
        ongoing support, resources, and updates to ensure the program’s long-term<br>
