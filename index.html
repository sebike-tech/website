    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>
        Based on the findings of the study, results revealed that Lumad adults in Glan, <br> 
        Sarangani Province have high knowledge and frequent use of medicinal herbs, however, <br>
        moderate perceived usefulness and duration of use indicate a gap between knowledge and sustained, <br>
        confident application. These concerns affect the safe, confident, and effective use of medicinal herbs for health management. <br>
        To address this, a Community Herbal Education Program is proposed as an intervention designed <br>
        to strengthen proper herbal medication practices through culturally responsive education, <br>
        integration of indigenous and scientific knowledge, and community-based training. <br>
        This program aims to promote responsible use of medicinal herbs and improve health outcomes among Lumad adults.
